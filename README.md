A cat dress up game built using JavaScript and CSS.  Lets get this cat some pajamas!

To be added: refactor using Canvas instead of layered CSS elements to allow for future extensibility and a future "download finished cat" button; more responsive styling.

Possible future ideas: online canvas editor allowing user to add clothes directly in browser; backend to share custom clothing options and completed cats.
